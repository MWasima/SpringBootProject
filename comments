Customer-focused Microservice Project:

### ✅ **What is a Simple Microservice Project?**

A **Simple Microservice Project** is a small, beginner-friendly software system made of **independent mini-applications** (called microservices) that work together to perform a bigger task.

Each microservice:
- ✅ Does **one job only** (e.g., manage customers, process orders, handle payments)
- ✅ Can be built, tested, and deployed **independently**
- ✅ Communicates with other services using **APIs (usually REST)**

### 🎯 **Example: Customer Order Management System**
You split the system like this:

| Microservice        | What it handles                          | Port |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|------|
| Customer Service     | Manages customer info (name, email)     | 8081 |
| Order Service        | Manages customer orders (items, price)  | 8082 |
| Payment Service      | Handles payment processing               | 8083 |

They **talk to each other via HTTP** instead of being one big app.

### 💡 Why Microservices Instead of One App?
- Easier to **maintain**
- Can use **different languages or tech** for each service
- Scales better
- If one fails, **others still work**

### 🛠️ Technologies Used (Simple Stack):
- Java + Spring Boot (or Node.js, Python, etc.)
- REST APIs
- H2/MySQL for databases
- Postman to test
- Eureka, Feign, or Gateway (optional for big systems)

### 💬 In Simple Words:
> “A simple microservice project is like building mini-apps that each do a small task — like handling customers, orders, or payments — and they talk to each other using APIs.”
